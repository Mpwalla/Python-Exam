              17.	Race

              
   iv.   Create a dataframe and perform the following analysis. Don’t forget to include the comments in your code.
              1.	A minimum of 5 data quality checks
              2.	Find the total number of survey participants, maximum, and minimum salary including additional compensation by employer industry.  Sort the data by participants and maximum compensation. Export the results to a csv.
              3.	Find the total number of survey participants by employer industry, country, education, gender, race. Export the results to csv.
